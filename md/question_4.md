Hierarchical clustering will be slower than k-means clustering except when the number of output clusters is close to the number of input clusters. Hierarchical clustering has a running time of O(n^2*ln(n)). It has a running time of O(1) when the number of output clusters is equal to the number of input clusters, and Omega(n*ln(n)) when the number of output clusters is very close to the number of input clusters. 

Meanwhile, the k-means clustering algorithm has a running time of O(n*k*i*d), where n is the number of input clusters, k is the number of output clusters, i is the number of iterations, and d represents the work to compare clusters, which depends heavily on the number of attributes being compared between clusters. If k and d are fixed, the running time of the k-means algorithm is O(n^(dk+1)) which effectively becomes O(n).
